    "In the present research, I am looking to answer the following question: if an investor wants to open a so-called ruin pub in Budapest, then in which of the 23 districts of Budapest would it be worth opening the pub?\n",
    "\n",
    "The ruin pub is a restaurant/pub developed from a ruined area, or building that is architecturally deliberately left in a ruined state. The Simple Garden, the first ruin pub in Budapest opened in 2004, followed by other pubs in the 7th district of Budapest and later spread to other inner districts. The interesting idea became an alternative fashion trend in Budapest and then quickly became very popular among tourists as well. From 2010 onwards, more and more new places have been opened, but in my opinion it would still be worth opening another ruin pub, but in a saturated market, the location has to be chosen well."
